# Parts_Bot
Refactor for Action Card bot from Service Titan form completions

This is a refactor for the python script found from my [StarService](https://github.com/starhound/StarService/blob/main/partsbot.py) repo.

Additional features include:
* Individual modules per function for easier debugging and expansions
* A reminder module for when no action has been taken after X days

Built atop of Jadolg's [RocketChatBot](https://github.com/jadolg/RocketChatBot).
